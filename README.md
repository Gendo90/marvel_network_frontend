# Marvel Social Network Frontend

## Summary
This app was created as a side-project to help me learn more about D3 and React and improve my software development skills. It currently shows all the shortest paths by degrees of connection (or separation) from one Marvel character to another using a "sankey" data visual.

The sankey part of this project is located [here](https://marvel-network-frontend.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used
- React (Hooks & Class Components)
- D3
